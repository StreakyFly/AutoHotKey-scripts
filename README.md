# AutoHotKey-scripts
AutoHotKey scripts that I have used or still use for whatever reason.

1. *screenshot_save.ahk*  
Take a screenshot and save it to a specific folder simply by pressing Shift+Space  
Libraries required: *CaptureScreen.ahk*, *Gdip_All.ahk*

2. *store_copied_text.ahk*  
Save selected text to a text file by pressing Ctrl+C=>+E

3. *purify_rich_text.ahk*  
If you copy a hyperlink or some weirdly formatted text (RTF - Rich Text Format), this script will *magically* convert it to plain text (it pastes it in Notepad, yes)

4. *does_something_to_all_downloaded_files_in_the_last_30_minutes.ahk*  
Well... this script does something to all downloaded files in the last 30 minutes... I felt like it could be useful in the future and then couldn't come up with a single use for it
